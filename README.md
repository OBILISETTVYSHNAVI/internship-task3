Aim:
To implement both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression techniques using the House Price Prediction Dataset, and evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics. The objective is to understand regression modeling, interpretation of coefficients, and the evaluation of predictive accuracy in real-world data.

Introduction:
Linear regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in supervised machine learning. It models the linear relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target).

This task focuses on:

Understanding the core concepts of simple and multiple linear regression.

Implementing a linear regression model using Python's scikit-learn library.

Evaluating the model with error metrics like MAE, MSE, and R².

Interpreting regression coefficients and visualizing model predictions.

We will use the House Price Prediction dataset, which contains various features of houses like the number of bedrooms, size, location attributes, and more. Our goal is to predict the price of a house based on these features.


1. Import and Preprocess the Dataset:

                Load the dataset using pandas.
                
                Check for missing values and handle them (if any).
                
                Convert categorical features into numerical format using techniques like Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
                
                Normalize or scale numerical features using StandardScaler if needed.
            
                Optionally apply transformations like log scaling on the target variable to reduce skewness.

2. Split the Dataset into Training and Testing Sets:

                Use train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection to divide your data.
                
                A common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.
                
                Set a random_state for reproducibility.

3. Train the Linear Regression Model:

                Use LinearRegression() from sklearn.linear_model.
                
                Fit the model on the training data.
                
                Extract and interpret model coefficients to understand the influence of each feature.

4. Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model:
            
                Predict the house prices on the test set.
                
                Evaluate the predictions using:
                
                MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – average magnitude of errors.
                
                MSE (Mean Squared Error) – penalizes large errors.
                
                R² Score – indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

5. Visualize the Results:

                Plot the actual vs predicted prices to visually assess model performance.
                
                Use a regression line or scatter plot for visualization.
                
                Optionally, visualize the distribution of residuals (prediction errors).

6. Interpret the Model:

                Analyze the coefficients to determine how each independent variable influences the house price.
                
                Understand the significance of R² and what it means in context.
                
                Discuss whether the model underfits or overfits based on the metrics and visualizations.
